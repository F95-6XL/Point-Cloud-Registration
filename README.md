This is the repository of the master thesis of Yimin Zhang.

High integrity localization is a fundamental task for an autonomous driving system. Standard localization approaches are usually accomplished by point cloud registration, which is often based on (recursive) least squares estimation, for example, using Kalman filters. However, due to the susceptibility of least squares minimization to outliers, it is not robust.

In this thesis, we introduce a new approach of robust localization technique for self-driving system.
The title of this thesis is "Investigation of maximum consensus techniques for robust localization".
